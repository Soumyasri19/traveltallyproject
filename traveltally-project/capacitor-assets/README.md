# Capacitor Assets

This directory contains resources for generating app icons and splash screens for your Capacitor app.

## Generating Icons and Splash Screens

To generate icons and splash screens from your source images, you can use the `capacitor-assets` tool:

```bash
npx capacitor-assets generate
```

## Source Images Requirements

- icon.png: Should be at least 1024x1024px
- splash.png: Should be at least 2732x2732px with the main content in the center 1200x1200px

If you update the source images, regenerate the assets using the command above.
